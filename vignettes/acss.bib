  Abstract                 = {Traditionally, models of complexity used in psychology have been based on probabilistic and algorithmic paradigms. While these models have inspired a great deal of research, they are generally opaque about the relationship between complexity and the cost of information processing. We argue that the psychological complexity is easily defined and quantified in terms of change and support this argument with a measure of complexity for binary patterns. We extend our measure to 2-D binary arrays, and show that it correlates well with a number of existing complexity and randomness measures, both subjective and objective. We suggest that measuring change represents an intuitively and mathematically transparent way of defining and quantifying psychological complexity which provides the missing link between subjective and objective approaches to complexity.

In the first part of the paper the models explaining deviations from randomness were presented. The key role of the structural limitations interpretation was suggested. Secondly, the multiple indexes of the deviation from randomness used in random sequence generation task studies were presented. The authors concluded that too many indexes are used in the studies of deviation from randomness. In order to avoid such problems two indexes were proposed: entropy and correlation function. The last part of the paper presents the preliminary version of the mathematical of random sequences generation in which the limited capacity of the short-term memory assumption was introduce.

  Abstract                 = {According to a recent hypothesis, executive functions should be particularly vulnerable to the effects of total sleep deprivation. Random generation is a task that taps executive functions. In three experiments we examined the effects of total sleep deprivation on random generation of key-presses, numbers, and nouns, in particular on the suppression of prepotent responses and the selection of next responses by way of applying a local-representativeness heuristic. With random key-presses suppression of prepotent responses did not suffer from lack of sleep, but it became poorer at a sufficiently high pacing rate. In contrast, suppression of prepotent responses suffered when numbers and nouns were generated. According to these findings different types of random generation tasks involve different types of inhibitory process. With only four response alternatives, but not with larger response sets, application of the local-representativeness heuristic was impaired after a night without slee},

  Abstract                 = {Based on interactions between number and space apparent from healthy subjects' randomization attempts we expected random number generation (RNG) to be sensitive for the monitoring of unilateral spatial deficits. Specifically, we predicted patients with left-sided hemineglect to evidence ``neglect in number space'', i.e. to produce a deficiency in the generation of small, ``left-sided'' numbers. In RNG of digits from 1 to 6, 19 patients with left-sided neglect generated sequences with a higher redundancy, but as many small numbers as did a matched control group. We discuss possible reasons for the absence of a small number neglect and emphasize that the observed redundancy was not due to a counting bias, as known from other neurological patients, but to an unspecific imbalance in the use of response alternatives. We speculate that this may be the consequence of disrupted fronto-parietal functions normally serving in the sequential organization and manipulation of items in working memory. (},

  Abstract                 = {The generation of random sequences is known to be a complex, demanding and effortful task for adults. This study explores random generation performance among children in 3 experiments. Exp 1 illustrates 8--10 yr olds' sensitivity to response speed requirements. Exp 2 shows that 8--11 yr olds were sensitive to the number of response alternatives, while there was equivalence in output quality over 2 types of instructional formats. Exp 3 reveals competencies in performance among 5--7 yr olds and shows that response repetitions are partly amenable to instructional emphasis. Across comparable studies, analysis confirmed a multidimensional structure to response sets. Generally, data show the potential utility of random generation as a developmental task with substantial and multifaceted attentional requirements. It is concluded that random generation is potentially a useful cognitive tool that can be administered to children. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},
