acss: measures of algorithmic complexity in R. 
====

## Features

* Main functionality is to provide the algorithmic complexity for short strings, an approximation of the Kolmogorov Complexity of a short string using the coding theorem method (see `?acss`). The database containing the complexity is provided in the data only package `acss.data`, this package provides functions accessing the data such as prob_random returning the posterior probability that a given string was produced by a random process. In addition, two traditional (but problematic) measures of complexity are also provided: entropy and change complexity.

For a full overview see our introductory paper:
