\title{Data from Experiment 1 in Gauvrit, Singmann, Soler-Toscano & Zenil}
\format{
A data.frame with 34 rows and 2 variables.
}
\source{
Gauvrit, Singmann, Soler-Toscano & Zenil (submitted). Complexity for psychology. A user-friendly implementation of the coding theorem method.

\usage{
exp1
}
\description{
34 participants were asked to produce at their own pace a series of 10 symbols among "A", "B", "C", and "D" that would "look as random as possible, so that if someone else sees the sequence, she will believe it is a truly random one".
