\usage{
entropy(string)

entropy2(string)

change_complexity(string)
}
\arguments{
\item{string}{\code{character} vector containing the to be analyzed strings (can contain multiple strings for the entropy measures).}
}
\value{
\code{numeric}, the complexity of the string. For \code{entropy} and \code{entropy2} of the same length as \code{string}. \code{change_complexity} currently only works with inputs of length 1.
}
\description{
Functions to compute different measures of complexity for strings: Entropy, Second-Order Entropy, and Change Complexity
}
\details{
For users who need advanced functions, a comprehensive package computing various versions of entropy estimators is available \pkg{entropy}. For users who just need first and second-order entropy and which to apply them to short string, the \pkg{acss} package provides two functions: \code{entropy} (first-order entropy) and \code{entropy2} second-order entropy.

Change complexity (\code{change_complexity}) assesses cognitive complexity or the subjective perception of complexity of a binary string. It has been comprehensively defined by Aksentijevic and Gibson (2012). Although the algorithm will work with any number of symbols up to 10, the rationale of Change Complexity only applies to binary strings.
